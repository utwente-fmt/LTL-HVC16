This folder contains the experimental results of UFSCC,
only for models that contain a counterexample (_F_).
Here, all counterexamples are computed exactly
(thus no ~number).

However, this trace generation takes some extra time,
which should be omitted from the actual cycle detection
time.

Therefore, only the counterexample sizes (the "ltl"
column) should be used for the discussion.
