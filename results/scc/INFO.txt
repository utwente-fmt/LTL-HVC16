This folder contains SCC characteristics for the models
(with and without LTL) used in the experiments. 
These results were computed using a single-threaded SCC 
search that tracks and reports the number of states in 
each SCC.

The obtained SCC information has been analyzed and e.g.
the largest SCC sizes have been extracted, as well as 
some related characteristics.
